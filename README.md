# Water Surface Prototype
Prototype of the water system from the game Rockhopper

## Features
This prototype includes basic water generation, as well as some UI elements to adjust the waves while viewing.
The waves are generated randomly, so they will appear differently on every restart.

## Purpose
This prototype, as provided, is intended as example of recent code I've created independently.

## Files
C# Source code can be found under /Assets/Scripts.
GLSL Source code can be found under /Assets/Shaders.
Other files under assets include basic prefabs and materials.
